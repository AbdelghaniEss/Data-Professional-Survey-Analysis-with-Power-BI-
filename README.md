# Professional Survey Data Analysis with Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing professional survey data using **Power BI** to gain insights into respondents' demographics, work conditions, preferences, and more. To prepare the data for analysis, initial data cleaning and transformation were conducted in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Process Outline

### Step 1: Data Preparation in Jupyter Notebook
1. **Data Import**: The original dataset, titled **Power BI - Final Project**, was in `.xlsx` format and was imported into Jupyter Notebook for preprocessing.
2. **File Conversion**: The `.xlsx` dataset was converted to a `.csv` format to ensure compatibility with further analysis steps.
3. **Column Management**: Irrelevant columns were removed to simplify the dataset, retaining only those essential for analysis.
4. **Standardization and Renaming**: Several columns were renamed for readability, and multiple values were standardized to ensure consistency across responses.
5. **Data Transformation**: Categories were consolidated, and responses with similar meanings were grouped to reduce redundancy and enhance analysis quality.
6. **Final Output**: After thorough data cleaning, the transformed dataset was saved as **Data Professional Survey.csv** for import into Power BI.

### Step 2: Data Analysis in Power BI
With the cleaned dataset in CSV format, analysis and visualizations were conducted in Power BI to explore key insights into various aspects of the professional survey data.

## Key Tools
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Power BI** for data visualization and detailed analysis.

## File Structure
- **Power BI - Final Project.csv**: The original survey dataset in Excel format.
- **Data Professional Survey.csv**: The cleaned and standardized dataset in CSV format, ready for Power BI analysis.
